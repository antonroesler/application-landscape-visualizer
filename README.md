## Rules for Contributors
1. Before a new feature is developed or a change is made, there must be an issue. If there is no issue: open one. The issue is so that everyone else knows what is happening and can comment on it. Everyone should actively participate in the communication.
2. For a new feature, create a new local branch - never work on the main branch. Once the feature is ready and the code works, create a pull request. For a new feature, create a new local branch - never work on the main branch. Once the feature is ready and the code works, create a pull request.
